## 📝 Detailed Script

### 【0:00-1:00】Opening: Energy Challenge & Research Motivation
> **[Slide: LLM Energy Consumption Statistics]**

"Good morning! Today we're presenting research that addresses an increasingly urgent challenge: **the energy consumption of Large Language Models**.

**Key Statistics**:
- Training a large Transformer can consume up to 1.287 million kWh
- Inference-phase energy optimization is equally critical, especially for high-frequency applications

**Core Question**:
How can we achieve energy-efficient LLM deployment through the synergy of **quantization techniques** and **hardware optimization**?

Existing research primarily focuses on individual factors, lacking a **systematic co-optimization framework**. This is the critical gap our research addresses."

### 【1:00-2:30】Methodology: Novel Metrics & Experimental Design
> **[Slide: Experimental Framework Diagram]**

"Our research comprises three core components:

#### **1. Quantization Strategy Evaluation** (30s)
Systematic assessment of INT8, FP16 mixed precision, and dynamic quantization
- Covering 6 models with 7B parameters
- Testing across 5 benchmark tasks: MMLU, ARC, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, HellaSwag

#### **2. Hardware Platform Analysis** (30s)  
Energy efficiency characteristics across 6 GPU platforms
- A100 PCIE, RTX 4090, V100, and other representative platforms
- Spanning three generations: Volta to Ada Lovelace architectures

#### **3. Novel Energy Efficiency Metrics** (30s)
Two innovative metrics capturing complex trade-off relationships:
- **EOR** = Task Performance Score / Energy Consumption (Wh) 
- **TWEOR** = Task Performance Score / (Energy Consumption × Inference Time)

Through real-time power monitoring at 1Hz sampling, we obtained precise energy consumption data."
